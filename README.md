(note : this project is currently on hold because bandcamp is making a new API and does not distribute new API keys at the moment. If you see an update on this subject, email me at pierre~at~lule~dot~fr)

XBMC Bandcamp plugin
====================

The goal of this plugin is to access [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) within the [XBMC](http://xbmc.org) media player. It's a young project without any release yet.

### Features

* Search band name
* Browse album and play songs

### Current state

This plugin is very new and doesn't have it's own API key to access [bandcamp's API](http://bandcamp.com/developer). If you want to try this plugin, you have to put yourself a key in 'resources/data/key.txt'. The script 'build.sh' is supposed to package the plugin correctly.

### TODO

* Have a key
* More efficient search
* Bugfixes
* Link to artists' pages
* Favorite artist and search history
* Proper interface to interact with other plugins
* Internationalisation
